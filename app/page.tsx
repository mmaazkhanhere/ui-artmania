          I conducted usability studies and created empathy maps to empathies with the app users. While researching, primary group was identified
          to be art students while the secondary group were artists
          <br />
          Research revealed that the user group faced variety of problem in their art careers including time mismanagement, artisitic block, lack
          of resources, limited access to art community, and no access to art experts.

          As an intern, I created personas which were fictional characters representing different users that will be using the product. Elizabeth

          create a Udemy animation course
