          I conducted usability studies and created empathy maps to empathies with the app users. While researching, primary group was identified
          to be art students while the secondary group were artists

          Research revealed that the user group faced variety of problem in their art careers including time mismanagement, artisitic block, lack
          of resources, limited access to art community, and no access to art experts.
